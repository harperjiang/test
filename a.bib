abstract = {MonetDB is a state-of-the-art open-source column-store database management system targeting applications in need for analytics over large collections of data. MonetDB is actively used nowadays in health care, in telecommunications as well as in scientific databases and in data management research, accumulating on average more than 10,000 downloads on a monthly basis. This paper gives a brief overview of the MonetDB technology as it developed over the past two decades and the main research highlights which drive the current MonetDB design and form the basis for its future evolution.},
